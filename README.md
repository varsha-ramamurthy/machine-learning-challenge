Machine Learning Homework

## Homework Description

Using machine learning, training and test data sets were used from a cumuative dataset of exoplanets to predict their presence. Upon installing all necessary libraries and importing dependencies, best fit model was used on the data to predict the accuracy. The testing data score showed to be more than the training data score. Hence making the training data the best model. A classification report using the test data was then prepared with a higher false positive. A report using the training set showed inconsistencies. The best fit model created by me can be used in finding theoretical expolanets.
